      TAGS
    There are different types of tags
1, Head tag: The head tag <head> contains all the elements describing the document.    
2, Title tag:(<title>)holds the name/title of the web page. This will display on the browser title bar.
   
3, Body Tag: This is where the web page content is written. Every html code must be written inside the body tag in order to be displayed on the web browser. This simply means if you write a code outside the body, it will not display on the browser.
   
4, Heading tags(H1-H6): Just as the name implies, they are used to differentiate a heading from a paragragh. They are used to explain the hierachy of texts or in a web page with <h1> being the biggest and <h6> the smallest. *The example is explained above*

5, Paragraph tag: The paragraph tag (<p>) is used to type the paragraph sentence in a web page.
    
6, Anchor tag: This tag is used to link one page to another. It helps a user to navigate through a website. It is usually accompanied by an 'href' attribute which enables you to insert the name of the page/file you want to link.

7, Image tag: It is usually written <img> and is a self-closing tag, this means it doesn't necessarily require to be closed like other tags.

Note:  When a tag(<>) is opened, it must always be closed(</>) to avoid error)

    ATTRIBUTES
Attributes provide more information about a tag. They also allow the manipulation of a tag.
    Types of Attributes
1, Href Attrribute: this goes with an anchor tag and it allows you to insert the name of the file or page you want to link.

2, Source(src) Attribute:This is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Just as the name implies, it provides the source i.e file path to an image.

3, The width and height Attributes: It allows you to size or resize an image or an element by give it a with and height.

4, Alt Attribute: this specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

5, Style attribute: this is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. *an example is the <H1> above.-->
